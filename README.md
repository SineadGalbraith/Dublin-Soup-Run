# Programming-Project-II

For my 2nd year Programming Group Project, we were asked to make an app for the Trinity VDP society soup runs. The aim of the app was to ensure the safety of the volunteers on the soup runs by tracking the amount of people at each location. 

The app was built using Android Studio. 

Once a member successfully logs into the app, they are presented with a menu from which they can either select to see the locations of the soup runs or they can enter the amount of people at their present location. The app incorporates google maps to display the locations of the soup runs as well as track the current users location which can be used to input the amount of people at that particular soup run.
